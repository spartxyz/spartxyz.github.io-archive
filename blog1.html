        <p class="blog-title">What is¬†Spart?</p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          <a href="https://www.spart.xyz/" target="_blank" class="soft-link">Spart</a> is a platform where artists of various mediums (visual, audio, writing) can engage and collaborate
          with each other in a stress free and relaxed environment. The point is to have fun¬†üòÉ!
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          I first thought of making Spart when I was listening to "epic soundtracks" on Youtube with the creative
          visuals in the background and the endless poems and stories in the comments. There are many popular Youtube
          channels that are built on the idea of bringing the work of composers and the work of visual artists together
          in such a way that the work compliments each other. I believe it's effective because viewers and listeners enjoy
          letting their imagination run free based off the stories that one image and a soundtrack can create.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          That's where Spart comes in. I think it would be a lot of fun for the artists if they were the ones that chose
          which music and which visuals they paired their artwork with. To complete the experience I've also brought in
          the writing portion of the collaboration so now artists can match their visuals, music, and poems and stories together with the work of others.¬†
          I've enjoyed drawing in the past and I've been slowing learning to create digital artwork with Procreate. Part
          of the reason that I created Spart and continue to work on it is because I would really enjoy watching people
          create music and write stories about the artwork I create. I hope other artists (maybe like you) feel the same way about this.
          Another benefit of empowering the artists to create these collaborations is that the focus is on the artists
          rather than the Youtube channel that brings the collaborations together. With the focus on the artist I'd like to
          be able to create a place where viewers (and other artists) can support the artists on the platform. More about this coming soon¬†üòÉ
        </p>

        <p class="blog-header">What's the End¬†Goal?</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          More than anything, I want Spart to become a community where artists can engage and interact with each other in fun and
          creative ways in a stress free and relaxed environment. Some of the artists I've talked to have said that posting on
          Instagram/DeviantArt/ArtStation etc is growing boring. All you do is post, like, and comment. I'd like to change that so
          that artists can more easily and more creatively interact with and inspire other artists and viewers. I've talked about
          pairing visuals, audio, and stories and poems together but what else do I have planned? Well, it's really up to the community
          and the artists that get involved but I'm going to list off some ideas that have been floating in my head.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-bullet">Back and Forth Story Boards</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          'Sparts' allow you to match one visual with one piece of writing but what if you wanted to continue the story?
          What if a visual artist and a writer could go back and forth with visuals and writing to write and visualize a longer story?
          I'd like to add a story feature to Spart where two users can 'match' with each other and create a visual and a
          piece of the story back and forth. Each visual further illustrates what's happening and each piece of writing further develops the story.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-bullet">Animations and Videos</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          This one I'm unsure about but animators and video editors may want to let composers add music and writers tell backstories for their animations or videos.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-bullet">Project Teams</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I really want to keep Spart casual and fun and project teams sounds a bit too formal and business like to me but if a
          group of artists create a collaboration they really love, shouldn't they be able to take it further? I could build out
          features that make this easy or perhaps I could just make it easy for artists who collaborate to contact each other. It's up to you!
        </p>

        <p class="blog-bullet">Real Time Collaborations</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          'Sparts' encourage collaborations between artists but they are still completed in the artists own time and that makes sense because artwork
          takes time but perhaps there is a way to allow artists to collaborate in real time. This one may take some thought. The point is
          to come up with creative ways for artists to engage, collaborate with each other, and have fun.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-bullet">Events</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Events is a pretty broad spectrum but we could plan events where artists come together to create artwork for
          fundraisers, for fun, or maybe for friendly competitions.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-header">OK, this all sounds great but, as an artist, I need to make a¬†living</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          At this point I hope the idea of Spart is starting to sound interesting to you. However, I understand that
          for many of you, you are likely trying to start a part or full time career as an artist. If that's not the case than at the least
          you probably wouldn't mind a few extra bucks to support your hobby. That being said, you probably want
          to try and find ways for other artists and consumers of artwork to support you financially. I am developing Spart with
          that in mind and I fully intend to introduce a payment system so that viewers can easily support the artwork you.
          As one person, I'm not trying to get rich or become the next Facebook (ew). I started this project because it sounded really fun to me and partially because
          I thought it would inspire me to continue working on my own artwork, which it has!
