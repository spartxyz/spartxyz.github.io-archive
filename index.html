          Spart is a place where you can express your interpretation of art through
          music, visuals, and writing. At the same time you can view an endless network
          of how other artists interpret artwork.

        <p class="content-block-text">
          The pattern of posting art and walking away without more interaction is over.
          At Spart we aim to create a platform where artists want to stay,
          browse, and interact with artists in more creative ways than before.

          Spart is just as much a community as it is a platform. We want to make your voice,
          concerns, and requests heard for the best experience possible. If there is something you
          would like to see in the platform you can mention it to us and also discuss it
          with other artists. We will do our best to make it happen.

          Well, we are actually just one person at the moment but more than that we are a community.
          This platform would be nothing without the people that interact with it.
